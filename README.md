## vim-asciidoc

This is a mirror of the vim syntax code from the
[asciidoc source](http://code.google.com/p/asciidoc/source/browse/#hg%2Fvim)

forked from https://github.com/gavinheavyside/vim-asciidoc/

tweaks to filetype detection: .asciidoc is asciidoc automatically, and 
.txt and .asc are scanned for optional detection as asciidoc
